# JSX - Behind The Scenes

JSX has enabled us to build beautiful web applications thanks to the ease of use and the rich framework and community built around it.

This is a minimal demo that I built to understand how Babel handles JSX and the process behind converting objects of virtual DOM to browser DOM nodes. This project uses Babel and custom functions to render the web page.

The project is ~~exact copy~~ inspired by the article in [JASON Format](https://jasonformat.com/) titled [WTF is JSX!](https://jasonformat.com/wtf-is-jsx/) A step by step explanation of the exact process can be found there starting from how Babel breaks down JSX to this very same demo.

#### Running Locally

To run this locally, I recommend using the Visual Studio Code's Live Server exension but any simple HTTP server would be sufficient that can launch the `index.html`
